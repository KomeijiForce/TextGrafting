# TextGrafting
**Overview**
Text Grafting generates high-quality, in-distribution weak supervision for minority classes in text classification tasks, combining the strengths of pseudo-label mining and LLM-based text synthesis.

**Motivation**
Current methods struggle with limited or no samples for minority classes, leading to poor classifier performance.

**Solution**
Text Grafting mines masked templates from the raw corpus and fills them with state-of-the-art LLMs to synthesize near-distribution texts for minority classes.
